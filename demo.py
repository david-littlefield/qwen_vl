text = "Okay so this is my black Chanel bag... it's the classic flap, um, I think it's called the medium or maybe the large? I always forget. It's the quilted one with the diamond pattern... caviar leather I think is what they call it. Got it for my 30th birthday from my husband, we were in Paris actually. It has the gold hardware, the chain... you can wear it crossbody or doubled up on the shoulder. Oh and it has the CC turnlock thing on the front. I usually use this for special occasions, like dinner dates or events. It's in pretty good condition, there's like a tiny scratch on the back but you can barely see it. Oh wait, I should mention it has the burgundy lining inside... maroon? Whatever that dark red color is called. There's a little pocket inside with a zipper and then an open pocket too. Still have the authenticity card somewhere."
# text = "Okay these are my Louboutins... the black ones. Super high heels, like crazy high. Um, they have that platform part at the front which makes them actually possible to walk in, sort of. They're leather, really nice smooth leather. I think these are called... Daffodils? Daffodile? Something like that, I can never remember the exact name. But they're the ones with the really thick platform. Got them for my anniversary... wait no, it was my promotion actually. I remember because I wore them to the celebration dinner and my feet were killing me by the end of the night. They have the red bottom obviously, that's like the signature thing. The heel is probably... I don't know, 5 inches? 6 inches? They're definitely over 5. I've only worn them maybe three or four times total, they're more like special occasion shoes, you know? For when I need to feel really dressed up. They're in great condition still, I always put them back in the dust bag. Oh and they're a size 38.5, which is like an 8 in US sizes I think. Classic black pumps but like, the fancy version. They go with everything but honestly they're not the most comfortable things in the world. Still love them though."
